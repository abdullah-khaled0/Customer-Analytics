📍 Project Overview

The project involved working with two essential datasets:

➡️ Segmentation data

➡️ Purchase data

📍 Objectives

The primary objectives of the project were as follows:

1 - Customer Segmentation: The project aimed to group customers based on shared characteristics such as age, gender, and more. By doing so, I enabled the customization of marketing, service, and sales efforts tailored to the specific needs of these groups. A potential boost in customer loyalty and conversion rates among different customer segments👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

2 - Descriptive Analysis: I performed an in-depth descriptive analysis on the purchase data to extract valuable insights 📊.

3 - Answering Key Questions: The project also addressed critical questions 🤔:

➡️ Purchase Probability: Will a customer buy a product from a particular product category when they enter the shop?

➡️ Brand Choice Probability: Which brand will the customer choose?

➡️ Purchase Quantity: How many units will the customer purchase?

Execution

Here's how the project was executed:

✔ Exploration and Standardization: Initially, I thoroughly explored and standardized the segmentation data. This was crucial for applying hierarchical clustering and K-Means clustering, along with PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

✔ Customer Segmentation: Next, I applied clustering techniques to segment customers into four distinct clusters: "Well-off," "Standard," "Career-focused," and "Fewer Opportunities."

✔ Descriptive Analysis: In the second phase, I conducted a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the purchase data to uncover valuable insights.

✔ Answering Key Questions: I addressed the three important questions using price elasticity models.

💡 Conclusion

Finally, I wrapped up the project by creating a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. This app allows users to segment customers based on various inputs and automates the data exploration process.
